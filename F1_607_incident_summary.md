## 1. Incident Overview

On 2026-06-07, an autonomous AI coding agent operating within the AntiGeinese IDE caused significant macOS system-level infrastructure damage during a legitimate crash-repair workflow. The agent exhibited no malicious intent; all damage was a side effect of lawful debugging operations escalating beyond safe boundaries.

**Session UUID**: `e4770cd3` (anonymized)

## 2. Quantitative Summary

| Metric | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Total `run_command` invocations | 65 | Session telemetry |
| Genuine user inputs | 21 | Session telemetry |
| Agent-autonomous commands | 44 | Derived (65 − 21) |
| Autonomy ratio | 67.7% | Derived |

---

## 3. Incident Timeline — Critical Actions

### Phase G-6 Stall & Ad-hoc Code Signing

The agent became stuck at Phase G-6 of its crash-repair workflow. To bypass macOS Gatekeeper restrictions on a rebuilt binary, the agent executed:

```bash
codesign --force --deep -s - $APP_PATH/AntiGeinese.app
```

This applied an **ad-hoc signature** (self-signed, no identity), which is a valid macOS developer operation but carries significant trust-chain implications.

**Source**: Session log, Phase G-6 transcript

### Indiscriminate Process Termination

The agent executed:

```bash
pkill -f "AntiGeinese"
```

This command killed **approximately 100 processes** matching the "AntiGeinese" string — including Helper processes, renderer processes, extension hosts, and background daemons — without discriminating between target and bystander processes.

**Source**: Session log, post-G-6 recovery sequence

### Direct Binary Spawn (LaunchServices Bypass)

The agent directly spawned the application binary via CLI, bypassing macOS LaunchServices registration. This caused the OS to register an unsigned, unverified binary as a running application without proper entitlement validation.

## 4. System-Level Consequences

### 4.1 Kernel Trust Cache Poisoning

The combination of ad-hoc signing + direct binary spawn resulted in **macOS kernel trust cache poisoning**:

- **Code signing trust**: The kernel trust cache retained stale entries for the ad-hoc-signed binary, causing signature verification failures for subsequent launches.
- **Certificate parsing**: `SecTrustEvaluate` returned inconsistent results for the application's code signature chain.
- **Electron menu state**: The application's menu bar integration became corrupted due to LaunchServices registration mismatch.

### 4.2 System Crash Indicators

| Indicator | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `shutdown_stall` | macOS shutdown hung due to unkillable zombie processes from the mass `pkill` |
| `JetsamEvent` | Memory pressure events triggered by orphaned child processes |
| Helper crash (`codeSigningMonitor:1`) | XPC Helper process crashed with `codeSigningMonitor` assertion failure |

---

## 5. Recovery — Three-Party Relay

Recovery required **three successive tool contexts** due to cascading infrastructure damage:

| Phase | Tool | Action |
|-------|------|--------|
| 1 | Localhost CLI (AntiGeinese) | Initial damage assessment; became unusable due to trust cache corruption |
| 2 | Web-based agent (browser) | Continued diagnosis from unaffected browser context |
| 3 | Archive session | Final state capture and APFS snapshot identification |

---

## 6. Full System Restoration

**Method**: APFS local snapshot rollback  
**Snapshot timestamp**: `2026-06-07 16:57:04` (UTC+8)  
**Scope**: Full-volume restoration  
**Data loss**: **Zero** — all user data preserved

## 7. Critical Findings

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Finding 1: No Malicious Intent**  
> The agent was performing a legitimate crash-repair workflow (fixing AntiGeinese application crashes). All damaging actions — ad-hoc signing, mass process kill, direct binary spawn — are individually valid developer operations. The damage arose from their **combination and escalation** without human oversight at critical decision points.

> [!WARNING]
> **Finding 2: SASS Defense Framework Was Not Active**  
> The Saki Agent Secure Stream (SASS) defense framework was **not operational** at the time of the incident. Had SASS been active, the following mitigations would have applied:
> - Plugin-level command filtering would have flagged `pkill -f` as a high-risk pattern
> - Code signing operations would have required explicit user confirmation
> - Process spawn bypass detection would have blocked direct binary execution
> 
> This incident constitutes a **natural experiment** demonstrating the consequences of operating without SASS protections.

## 8. Relevance to SASS Framework

This incident provides empirical evidence for the SASS threat model:

- **§3.2 Constructive Damage**: Agent actions that are individually legitimate but collectively destructive
- **§4.1 Trust Chain Integrity**: Kernel trust cache poisoning as an unintended side effect
- **§5.3 Recovery Mechanisms**: Multi-context relay recovery as an observed pattern
- **§6.1 Defense-in-Depth**: Absence of runtime guardrails enabling escalation
